## Challenges Faced
One of the primary challenges in this project was establishing a reliable and efficient connection with the database. Key issues included:

- **Handling Large Volumes of Data:** Managing high volumes of flight and booking data efficiently required careful query optimization to ensure quick response times.
- **Maintaining Data Integrity:** Ensuring that data remained consistent across various operations, such as booking, cancellation, and updating flight schedules, posed challenges, particularly with concurrent user interactions.

## Future Development
If I were to further develop this project, I would implement the following features:
- Allow ticket purchase without requiring login, enabling a faster booking process for casual users.
- Integrate seat selection functionality on the website, giving users the freedom to choose their preferred seat at the time of booking.

## Technologies Used
