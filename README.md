# Airline Ticket Reservation System
Online airline ticketing saves time and money for the customer as well as the airline company thereby making air travel more customer-centric. 
This project is an attempt to simulate the basic concepts of an airline reservation system.

Our airline ticket reservation system has the following features:- 

*Customers can:*
* Create an account
* Search for available flights for a particular city-pair
* Book tickets in the class of their choice
* Cancel booked tickets
* View booked tickets history 

*Administrators can:*
* Add/Modify flight schedules
* Viewing the booked ticket statistics

This system also incorporates a frequent flier miles points system for loyal customers which will provide additional benefits to them.


This project was implemented using HTML & CSS for the front-end and PHP for the back-end. The database was created and updated using MySQL.
